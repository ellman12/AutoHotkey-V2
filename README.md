# AutoHotkey-V2

WIP
Goals of V2:
    More organized
    Make everything a module that can be easily added/removed from this script or someone else's script if they desire
        header file if needed for like gui init and other init stuff
        hotkey(?) file for the hotkeys and stuff
    
    less useless crap
